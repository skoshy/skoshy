Howdy :)

I'm a Full-Stack (frontend-leaning) Developer specializing in React and React Native based applications. I love building beautiful, performant experiences with attention to detail, proper planning, clean code, and clear communication.

I have over 10 years experience in a full-time, professional capacity at multiple start-ups, but I've been coding since I was in 2nd grade, making Xanga and MySpace templates. My first webpage I made was one dedicated to Kirby, my favorite video game character back then!

I use a separate GitHub account for full-time work, so my activity here is mostly for personal projects, private and public.
